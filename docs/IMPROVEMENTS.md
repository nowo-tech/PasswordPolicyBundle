## 🔴 Critical (High Priority)

### 1. ✅ Implement `getResetPasswordRouteName()` - COMPLETED

**Problem**: The `getResetPasswordRouteName()` method in `PasswordExpiryService` was empty, even though it was defined in the interface and used in configuration.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Added `resetPasswordRouteName` to `PasswordExpiryConfiguration` as a readonly property
- ✅ Implemented the `getResetPasswordRouteName()` method in `PasswordExpiryService` with support for optional entity class parameter
- ✅ Updated `PasswordPolicyExtension` to pass `reset_password_route_name` from configuration
- ✅ Updated the `PasswordExpiryServiceInterface` interface to include the optional parameter
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for the new functionality

**Modified Files**:
- `src/Model/PasswordExpiryConfiguration.php`
- `src/Service/PasswordExpiryService.php`
- `src/Service/PasswordExpiryServiceInterface.php`
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php`
- `tests/Unit/Service/PasswordExpiryServiceTest.php`

### 2. ✅ Complete Redirection in PasswordExpiryListener - COMPLETED

**Problem**: There was a commented TODO about redirection when the password expires. It only showed a flash message.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Implemented optional redirection to the password change route using `reset_password_route_name`
- ✅ Added `redirect_on_expiry` configuration (default: `false`) to enable/disable automatic redirection
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with current behavior (only flash message by default)
- ✅ Added graceful error handling if the route doesn't exist (doesn't break the application)
- ✅ Removed TODO and commented code

**Modified Files**:
- `src/EventListener/PasswordExpiryListener.php`
- `src/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php`
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php`

### 3. ✅ Improved Configuration Validation - COMPLETED

**Problem**: There was no validation that `reset_password_route_name` was a valid route or that it existed. Routes in `notified_routes` and `excluded_notified_routes` were also not validated.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Validation that `reset_password_route_name` is not empty (required)
- ✅ Validation that all routes in `notified_routes` are non-empty strings
- ✅ Validation that all routes in `excluded_notified_routes` are non-empty strings
- ✅ Validation at container compilation time (in `PasswordPolicyExtension::load()`)
- ✅ Clear and descriptive error messages with `ConfigurationException`
- ✅ Basic type and value validation (full route existence validation is done at runtime)

**Modified Files**:
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php`

## 🟡 Important (Medium Priority)

### 4. ✅ Logging System - COMPLETED

**Problem**: There was no logging of important events (password expiration, reuse attempts, etc.).

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Integrated with Symfony Logger (LoggerInterface)
- ✅ Logging of important events:
  - ✅ Password expired detected (with user information and route)
  - ✅ Password reuse attempt (with user information and days since use)
  - ✅ Successful password change (with removed entries information)
  - ✅ Error in reset route generation
- ✅ Configurable log level (`log_level`: debug, info, notice, warning, error)
- ✅ Optional logging (`enable_logging`: true/false)
- ✅ Optional logger (uses NullLogger if not available)

**Modified Files**:
- `src/EventListener/PasswordExpiryListener.php`
- `src/EventListener/PasswordEntityListener.php`
- `src/Validator/PasswordPolicyValidator.php`
- `src/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php`
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php`

### 5. ✅ Symfony Events for Extensibility - COMPLETED

**Problem**: There were no custom events that allowed developers to extend the behavior.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Created custom events:
  - ✅ `PasswordExpiredEvent` - Dispatched when password expiration is detected
  - ✅ `PasswordHistoryCreatedEvent` - Dispatched when history entry is created
  - ✅ `PasswordChangedEvent` - Dispatched when password is changed
  - ✅ `PasswordReuseAttemptedEvent` - Dispatched when password reuse is attempted
- ✅ Events integrated into listeners and services
- ✅ Optional EventDispatcher (doesn't break if not available)
- ✅ Developers can listen to these events to extend functionality

**New Files**:
- `src/Event/PasswordExpiredEvent.php`
- `src/Event/PasswordHistoryCreatedEvent.php`
- `src/Event/PasswordChangedEvent.php`
- `src/Event/PasswordReuseAttemptedEvent.php`

**Modified Files**:
- `src/EventListener/PasswordExpiryListener.php`
- `src/EventListener/PasswordEntityListener.php`
- `src/Validator/PasswordPolicyValidator.php`
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php`

### 6. ✅ Cache for Performance Improvement - COMPLETED

**Problem**: Each request checks if the password expired, which can be expensive.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Cache password expiration status per user (using user ID, class, and password change timestamp)
- ✅ Automatically invalidate cache when password is changed
- ✅ Optional and configurable cache (`enable_cache`, `cache_ttl`)
- ✅ Integration with Symfony Cache Component (`cache.app`)
- ✅ Smart cache key that includes password change timestamp for automatic invalidation
- ✅ Configurable TTL (default: 3600 seconds / 1 hour)

**Modified Files**:
- `src/Service/PasswordExpiryService.php` - Implemented cache with automatic invalidation
- `src/Service/PasswordExpiryServiceInterface.php` - Added `invalidateCache()` method
- `src/EventListener/PasswordEntityListener.php` - Cache invalidation when password changes
- `src/DependencyInjection/Configuration.php` - Cache configuration
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php` - Cache service injection
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - Complete cache documentation

### 7. ✅ Support for Multiple Entities with Different Policies - COMPLETED

**Problem**: Although multiple entities can be configured, there was no validation to ensure no conflicts.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Validation of duplicate routes between entities (`reset_password_route_name` and `notified_routes`)
- ✅ Validation at container compilation time
- ✅ Clear error messages indicating which entities have conflicts
- ✅ Complete documentation with examples of multiple entities
- ✅ Configuration examples for different user types (User, Admin, ApiUser)
- ✅ Best practices guide for multiple entities

**Modified Files**:
- `src/DependencyInjection/PasswordPolicyExtension.php` - `validateDuplicateRoutes()` method
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - Complete "Multiple Entities Configuration" section with examples

### 8. ✅ Date Validation in PasswordExpiryService - COMPLETED

**Problem**: There was no validation that `passwordChangedAt` is not a future date.

**Implemented Solution**:
- ✅ Validation that `passwordChangedAt` is not in the future in `isPasswordExpired()`
- ✅ If the date is in the future, it's treated as "not expired" (continues with next entity)
- ✅ Implemented in `PasswordExpiryService::isPasswordExpired()` lines 96-99
- ✅ Tests added: `testIsPasswordExpiredWithFutureDate()`

**Modified Files**:
- `src/Service/PasswordExpiryService.php` - Future date validation
- `tests/Unit/Service/PasswordExpiryServiceTest.php` - Test for future date

## 🟢 Improvements (Low Priority)

### 9. Metrics and Statistics

**Solution**:
- Add methods to obtain statistics:
  - Days until expiration
  - Number of passwords in history
  - Last change date
- Useful for dashboards and reports

**New Files**:
- `src/Service/PasswordPolicyStatisticsService.php`

### 10. Proactive Notification Support

**Solution**:
- Notify before expiration (e.g., 7 days before)
- Configurable number of days in advance
- Integration with notification system (email, SMS, etc.)

**New Files**:
- `src/Service/PasswordExpiryNotificationService.php`
- `src/EventListener/PasswordExpiryNotificationListener.php`

### 11. Password Complexity Validation

**Solution**:
- Integrate with existing complexity validators
- Add configuration options for:
  - Minimum/maximum length
